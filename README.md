1. I have disabled jekyll by adding `.nojekll` because I donâ€™t want GitHub Pages to process your site with Jekyll.
2. Icons are necessary otherwise you click on `Add to homescreen` button you won't see the `Install` button rather you'll see a "Editable App" name field with "Add" button which looks pathetic.
3. I made two icons with 192x192 and 512x512 size usin figma.
